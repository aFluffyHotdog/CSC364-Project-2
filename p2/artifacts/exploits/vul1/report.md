- Category: SQL injection
- Rootcause: an SQL command like`' OR '1'='1` can be used as a username and a password in order to bypass login screen due to the fact that `login.php` uses format string in order to form an SQL query. In that case, we can add that line which will force the conditional to evaluate to true for both username and password, returning back a random user which we'll now be logged in as.
- Fix: We can use the PDO object created in db.php to build a query. PDO is safer because it uses prepared statements that are sent over to the server before any user input is sent over. This way, the server knows what format to expect first. PDO also ensures that any text users input in will be escaped properly and thus, not treated as SQL code.

*Note that this is still not entirely secure because we're transporting someone's password unhashed. Mallory could catch this network request and see anyone's password.
